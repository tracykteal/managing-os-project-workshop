# Managing an Open Source Project workshop

by Tracy K. Teal

This repository contains materials for a Managing an Open Source Project workshop. See [https://tracykteal.github.io/managing-os-project-workshop/](https://tracykteal.github.io/managing-os-project-workshop/) for rendered workshop materials.

This workshop was first delivered at [posit::conf(2023)](https://posit-conf-2023.github.io/managing-os-project/). This is the version of the workshop that is being actively updated, and is a work-in-progress. 

Please reach out if you're interested in using these materials in a workshop! I'd love to hear about it, and help where I can.
